# IDE Free Development 

This file explains what you need to know if you want to develop in C entirely through the terminal.

It highlights the value of working independently of IDEs, especially in cases like IDE installation issues or having to work in different development environments (such as WSL or SSH).

Knowing how to use a terminal-based text editor like nano, vim, or emacs can make this process much easier.
